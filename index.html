        <h2>Development Process & Insights</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Process:</strong> The development of the "Lights Out" game involved breaking down the logic of the game into manageable components. I started by creating the grid layout, then developed the game logic where each click toggles the state of the square and its neighbors. Finally, I implemented the win condition, which checks if all the squares are in the "off" state.</p>
        <p><strong>2. Creative Choices:</strong> For the design, I chose a soft pastel color palette to create a relaxing and user-friendly environment. The grid layout was designed to be flexible, with responsive behavior for mobile devices. The interaction design includes hover effects and smooth transitions for better user feedback.</p>
        <p><strong>3. Challenges Faced:</strong> One major challenge was ensuring that the grid was responsive, especially when the screen size changed. At first, the squares would overflow on smaller screens, but by using percentage-based widths and maintaining the square aspect ratio with padding, I was able to make the game fit well on all devices.</p>
        <p><strong>4. Overcoming Challenges:</strong> I addressed the responsiveness issue by using CSS grid and the `fr` unit for the grid columns and rows, allowing the grid to adjust its size dynamically based on the container. The aspect ratio of the squares was maintained using a `padding-bottom` technique, which helped in making sure the squares are always square-shaped.</p>
        <p><strong>5. Insights Gained:</strong> I gained a deeper understanding of CSS grid layouts and responsive design. I also learned how to manage user interactions in JavaScript more effectively, especially when it comes to toggling states and checking win conditions in puzzle games.</p>
